This BachelorÂ´s Degree Final Project involves the development of an automated system that collects, stores, transforms, and displays musical data on the top ten most listened-to songs on Spotify from ten selected countries: Spain, Italy, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.

The main goal is to present this data in an accessible and meaningful way to users, utilizing technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the Spotify API, and Power BI for visualization.
